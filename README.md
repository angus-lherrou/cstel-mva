# Holo | Scholar
![Codestellation 2019](branding/repo-img.png?raw=true)
## Information
This project tackles the problem of incorporating interactive elements into traditional educational materials.

Many people find it easier to learn from a physical book in their hands than a PDF, website, or app. However, choosing physical over digital precludes the possibility for interactive elements in learning resources. Holo | Scholar endeavors to fill this gap.

Holo | Scholar is a mixed-reality solution using the Microsoft HoloLens to display dynamic, interactable content that has been "embedded" into a physical resource. In its complete implementation, Holo | Scholar would consist of:
* installations in educational institutions such as schools, universities, and libraries, and 
* partnerships with publishers to integrate mixed-reality elements into their textbooks, journals, or other publications.

## Future development
Next steps for development include:
* Incorporating image/tag recognition to contextualize interactive elements
* Building a UWP app to house the compiled application
* Hunting bugs and documenting code
## Components
* [ModelBank](ModelBank/): C# object-oriented resource location indexing-by-page solution
* [Holo | Scholar App](uwp/): Unity-based HoloLens integration
